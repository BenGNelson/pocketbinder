"""
Card catalog indexer — loads the Pokémon TCG catalog (sets + cards) from a
read-only clone of the public pokemon-tcg-data dataset into SQLite, and
(optionally) refreshes market prices for the cards you own.

An in-app background worker: a daemon thread started from the app lifespan,
reading the already-mounted read-only data dir. The first pass
parses ~170 set files / ~20k cards and upserts them (a few seconds); later passes
skip unchanged set files by mtime, so they're cheap. The catalog is refreshed on
the host by a `git pull` of the dataset — this thread just re-ingests what's on
disk, so it works entirely offline.

Card face IMAGES are never fetched here — the router proxies + caches them on
demand (routers/cards.py). The only network use is the OPTIONAL price refresh,
which runs only when a pokemontcg.io API key is configured and only for cards you
own (a bounded set), keeping value ≤1 day stale without pricing all 20k cards.
